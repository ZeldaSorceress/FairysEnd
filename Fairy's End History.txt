The Fairies were an ancient race that were very similar to the Druids. They worshipped nature and only listened to what nature told them. One day there was a massive amount of poisonous air that engulfed their entire land. The one they worshipped most was the Goddess of Nature & Rebirth. She ordered her subjects to evacuate to the new land she created for them so that they would no longer suffer from the poison. However this did not solve the issue completely. The Goddess used all of her power to remove the poison from the land, but she could only manage to drive away about 80% of the poison before her powers drained. When her powers drained so to did her spirit and she vanished with no trace. Some say that the Fairies still exist even without her protection. If they do still exist then there might not be many left...
